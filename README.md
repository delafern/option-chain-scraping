Option Chain Scraping

Pull a bunch of option sheets from yahoo finance and plot strike vs date vs premium in a way for an investor to make sound decisions on the market. Mainly for practice using classes and webscraping, code may be a bit disorganized and could be much cleaner, but a fun weekend project nonetheless.
